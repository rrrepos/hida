### Content Guidelines
This has all the information that helps author create content in a manner that hida can render effectively.

#### Topic Information
Since a channel is a collection of topics and must be shown to the users (via the list of topics question), it needs to have some standard information. These are (*shown with an example*):

##### Topic Title 
A short title that will appear in lists as well as when starting a topic e.g. **Character Strengths**

##### Topic Desc 
A few words that will appear on the list of topics screens e.g. **It covers information on: what are character strengths; its purpose; the different types; and how to use them. This is based on a workshop conducted by LEADS**.

##### Topic Images
Images are a great way to break the monotony of plain text. This is both while listing in topic list as well as when starting a topic. The platform needs (optionally) two images: small is 48x48 px and a large one of 192x192 px.

##### Topic Actions
This is where the author chooses which of the modes that particular topic should support viz. **E**xplain, **A**sk or **T**est.
