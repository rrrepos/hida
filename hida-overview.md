## Terminology
- **Channel**: This holds all the organisations content that is available to a user by using an **invocation** in Google Assistant. For example, in the demo, **Talk to Digital Trainer** was the invocation that directed all requests from the user to the *Digital Trainer* content. For purposes of convenience, we call this customised content and its working as a **Channel**.
- **Topics**: For purposes of ease, the hida platform groups content into **Topics**. Topics help a user identify the content they are interested in. Examples of a topic can be: *HR Policy*, or even just *Leave Policy*, or *Product Details of ...* and so on. We recommend that a topic should not be very large for better performance; hence a scope where all the contents of a topic can get answered in about **50 questions** would be a suitable size.
